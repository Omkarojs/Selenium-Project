This is the project of Automation testing using java language and Selenium Framework.
I have tested the Amazon Website and their webpage using Selenium Script. 
This project has 5 classes which are created as per 5 webpages of Amazon Website.
I have used Test NG framework to Add and Priorotize test cases so to make testing easy with code.
I have used Javascript Executor, Test Annotations, Locators, Action class, Select Class, Web Elements, 
Wait Mechanism and Window class to automate Web Pages

 These Web Pages are: -
1. Login Page
2. Home Page
